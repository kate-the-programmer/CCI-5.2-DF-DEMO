# RAID Visualization Tool

## Overview
The RAID Visualization Tool provides an interactive way to understand, visualize, and simulate Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) technology. This educational tool demonstrates how data is stored across multiple disks in various RAID configurations and how the system handles disk failures and data recovery.

## Features and Capabilities
- **Interactive Visualization**: See how data is distributed across multiple disks in real-time
- **RAID Level Simulation**: Visualize different RAID configurations and their operations
- **Failure Simulation**: Demonstrate how RAID systems handle disk failures
- **Recovery Visualization**: Show the recovery process when replacing failed drives
- **Performance Metrics**: Display theoretical read/write performance for different RAID levels
- **Storage Efficiency**: Calculate and display storage efficiency for different configurations

## How to Use the Tool
1. **Launch the Tool**: Click the "Launch RAID GUI" button in the main interface
2. **Select RAID Level**: Choose the RAID level you want to visualize from the dropdown menu
3. **Configure Parameters**: Set the number of disks, stripe size, and other parameters
4. **Visualize Data Distribution**: Use the visualization panel to see how data blocks are distributed
5. **Simulate Failures**: Click on disks to simulate failures and see how the system responds
6. **Demonstrate Recovery**: Follow the recovery steps to restore the array to full functionality

## RAID Levels Supported
- **RAID 0 (Striping)**: Data striped across multiple disks for improved performance, no redundancy
- **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**: Data mirrored across disks for redundancy, reduced storage efficiency
- **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)**: Data and parity information striped across disks, can survive one disk failure
- **RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)**: Similar to RAID 5 but with two parity blocks, can survive two disk failures
- **RAID 10 (1+0)**: Combination of mirroring and striping for both performance and redundancy

## Common Use Cases
- **Educational Demonstrations**: Teaching students about RAID technology and principles
- **Forensic Analysis Planning**: Understanding how to recover data from failed RAID systems
- **Decision Support**: Helping system administrators choose the appropriate RAID level for their needs
- **Recovery Practice**: Practicing RAID recovery techniques in a simulated environment
- **Performance Comparison**: Comparing the theoretical performance of different RAID configurations

## Technical Notes
- The visualization tool is a simulation and does not interact with actual disk hardware
- Performance metrics are theoretical and may differ from real-world scenarios
- The tool is designed for educational purposes and may simplify certain complexities of real RAID implementations
